# Personal Resume Website


![alt-text](img/Preview.gif 'preview')

This is my own personal resume website written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I spent about 2 weeks working on it (starting from the design process to the publishing to the internet)

## HTML

The website contains four pages:

- **index.html**
- **resume.html**
- **projects.html**
- **contact.html**

## CSS

The website is responsive for all devices with common aspect ratio, and for most of the devices with uncommon aspect ratio

All styles, including Media Queries, are written in a single file **styles.css**

The font used for all text elements is **Inter**, with *regular*, *medium*, *semi-bold*, and *bold* variants

## JavaScript

I used 2 external libraries to add dynamic features to the website:

- **TypedScript** (self-typing text)
- **EmailJS** (forms submission)

The JavaScript executes from 2 files:
- **script.js** (Self-typing headers, animations)
- **form.js** (form submission)
