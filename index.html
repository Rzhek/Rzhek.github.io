                <p class="about-text">My name is Vlad, and I am 18-years-old High School Senior, who is going to graduate this May. I’m going to continue my education in the University of Central Florida and study Computer Science. But before that, I want to test my skills and get a real experience from working in that industry. My programming journey began long time ago: when I was about 11. I discovered the way how you can make websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From that time, I’ve been learning many other programming languages: PhP, Java, C#, but Python became my favorite. I just like how it doesn’t require long unnecessary syntax, but at the same time provide very powerful tools, and can be used almost everywhere: Web, Data Science, AI, Desktop Applications. Besides that, I’m still pretty familiar with other programming languages I learned before, and can get used to code in them very quickly.</p>
